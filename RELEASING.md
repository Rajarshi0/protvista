# Releasing

ProtVista ships from two branches, and their release processes are **not** the same — read the table before you publish.

- **`main`** — the stable 4.x line. Publishes to the npm **`latest`** dist-tag (the default `npm install protvista-uniprot`), so every existing user gets it. Higher stakes; test thoroughly.
- **`next`** — the v5 line. Publishes to the **`beta`** dist-tag (opt-in via `@beta`); `latest` stays on 4.x.

Publish from a machine with npm auth (`npm login`) — the sandbox/CI GitHub credentials do **not** cover npm. Always use **`npm publish`**, never `pnpm publish`: pnpm applies its own git checks and republish rules on top of npm's, and `test:pack` already packs with npm (`--pack npm`), so publishing with npm keeps the tarball that was validated identical to the one that ships.

## Differences at a glance

| | `main` (4.x) | `next` (v5 beta) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| npm dist-tag | `latest` | `beta` (`publishConfig.tag`) |
| Version | `4.9.x` semver | `5.0.0-beta.N` |
| Package manager | **yarn** (`yarn.lock`) | **pnpm** (`packageManager`) |
| Build on publish | **manual** — `yarn build` first (no `prepack`) | automatic (`prepack: pnpm build`) |
| Pre-publish gate | **none** — run `yarn test` yourself | `prepublishOnly: pnpm test:pack` |
| Files to bump | `package.json` only | `package.json` **+** the version pins (see below) |
| GitHub release | optional | cut `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` — fires `publish-starter-kit.yml` |
| Stakes | high — the default install | low — opt-in testers |

## Releasing `main` (stable 4.x → `latest`)

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
npm login                                   # if not already authed
rm -rf node_modules dist && yarn install --frozen-lockfile
yarn test                                   # no publish gate on main — run it yourself
npm version patch                           # e.g. 4.9.3 -> 4.9.4; commits + tags v4.9.4
yarn build                                  # REQUIRED — main has no prepack
npm publish --dry-run                       # inspect the tarball (safe on main — no re-pack lifecycle)
npm publish                                 # -> latest (main has no publishConfig.tag)
npm dist-tag ls protvista-uniprot           # expect latest: 4.9.4
git push --follow-tags                      # push the bump commit + the tag
```

Use `npm version minor` instead of `patch` if the release includes a feature. Cutting a GitHub release for the tag is optional (4.x historically didn't).

## Releasing `next` (v5 beta → `beta`)

Write `RELEASE_NOTES.md` (git-ignored), then run:

```bash
git checkout next && git pull
pnpm release:next                  # 5.0.0-beta.N -> 5.0.0-beta.N+1, or pass a version
```

`scripts/release-next.sh` does every step below. It checks the branch, the
working tree, the release notes and your npm and GitHub logins first. It then
bumps and repins, dates the CHANGELOG's `## Unreleased` heading, runs
`pnpm test && pnpm validate` and commits `Release <version>`. Nothing leaves
your machine until it asks you to confirm the publish. `--prepare-only` stops
after the commit. If a publish step fails, fix the cause and run it again: it
resumes from the release commit and skips whatever already happened.

The manual steps, for reference:

```bash
git checkout next && git pull
# 1. Bump package.json version, then repin every jsDelivr @version reference:
#      starter-kit/index.html, starter-kit/README.md,
#      starter-kit/recipes/extend-uniprot.yaml,
#      docs/src/content/docs/{tutorial,embed,configure}.md
#    and the banner version strings in README.md + starter-kit notices.
pnpm test && pnpm validate                  # the pin specs fail loudly on any missed reference
npm publish                                 # prepack builds; prepublishOnly runs test:pack; -> beta
npm dist-tag ls protvista-uniprot           # beta: 5.0.0-beta.N, latest: 4.9.x
git commit -am "Release X.Y.Z-beta.N" && git push
git tag vX.Y.Z-beta.N && git push origin vX.Y.Z-beta.N
gh release create vX.Y.Z-beta.N --verify-tag --prerelease --title vX.Y.Z-beta.N --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES.md
```

Notes for `next`:

- **Do not use `npm publish --dry-run` here.** It exports `npm_config_dry_run`, which leaks into the `npm pack` that `attw` runs inside `prepublishOnly` and makes it fail on a missing tarball. To rehearse, run `pnpm test:pack` (no dry-run wrapper) instead.
- The jsDelivr CDN pins are enforced by `starter-kit.spec.ts` and `schema-publishing.spec.ts`; a stale pin fails `pnpm test`. Leave alone: `src/styles/css-prefix.ts` (keyed to the `5.0.0` base line, not the `-beta.N` suffix) and the bare `@4.9.x` mentions in docs prose (they name the published stable release).
- Cutting the GitHub release fires `publish-starter-kit.yml`, which mirrors `starter-kit/` to the template repo. If the kit carries a `protvista:unpublished` notice, the workflow strips it once the pinned version is live on npm; it polls the registry for up to 15 minutes, because the release can land before the npm publish is visible (5.0.0-beta.3 shipped its banner that way). After a release, check the [template repo](https://github.com/ebi-webcomponents/protvista-starter-kit) shows no "does not work yet" notice. If it does, open that release's run under **Actions → Publish starter kit** and choose **Re-run all jobs**: the npm check passes the second time. (The **Run workflow** button only appears once this workflow file is on the default branch, `main`.)
