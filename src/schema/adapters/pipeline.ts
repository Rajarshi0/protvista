/**
 * Decode → validate → build: the pipeline that replaces the adapter grid.
 *
 * A source's **format** says how its bytes are encoded; a track's **shape**
 * says which records it needs. Neither knows about the other, so the ten
 * `<shape>-<format>` adapters were the cross-product of two independent
 * facts — a grid that grows multiplicatively and has to be named, registered,
 * documented and drift-tested cell by cell. Here the cross-product is
 * computed instead: four decoders, three shape builders, one composition.
 *
 * ```
 * bytes ──decode(format)──▶ records ──build(shape)──▶ what the component renders
 * ```
 *
 * Every source resolves through here — a fetched body, an inline block, a
 * `setTrackData()` payload — so one file read one way cannot come out two
 * different ways depending on where it entered. See "Shape and format
 * (normative)" in `specs/config-approach.md`.
 *
 * `formatLabel` is threaded through rather than derived so a caller can name
 * the input in the author's own terms: the file path they wrote, or "inline
 * data" when there is no path to name.
 *
 * A caller may also pass a `coordinates` sink to collect each decoded row's
 * coordinates and row number, for the sequence-bounds warning
 * (`./coordinates`), without touching the payload. A `warnings` sink
 * likewise collects a feature decoder's findings (columns it dropped,
 * colours a browser will not paint) instead of the decoder logging them.
