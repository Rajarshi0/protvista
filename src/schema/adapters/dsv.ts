/**
 * Shared parser core for the delimited (CSV/TSV) readers and `bed`.
 *
 * Three independent pieces live here so they can be reused without
 * dragging the feature-mapping opinions along:
 *
 *   - `parseDelimited()` is a format-agnostic RFC-4180 tokenizer. It
 *     knows about quoting and delimiters, nothing about ProtVista
 *     features. `bed` does *not* use it — BED is headerless and
 *     positional with no quoting to honour, so `bed` hand-splits on
 *     tabs and shares only `parseDecimal` and the `FeatureRecord` shape
 *     from this module.
 *   - `rowsToFeatureRecords()` layers the ProtVista feature convention
 *     on top: a required `type,start,end,description[,score]` header,
 *     numeric coercion, and strict, row/column-named error reporting.
 *     Every other column is kept on the record (see `./feature-fields`).
 *   - `rowsToPointRecords()` is its sibling for the graph kinds: the same
 *     header/ragged/number discipline over a `position,value` header,
 *     emitting the `{ position, value }` records `linegraph` consumes.
 *     A second layer rather than an option on the first, because the two
 *     share no columns and nothing but the validation grammar.
 *   - `parseDecimal()` is the shared strict-number validator, reused by
 *     `bed` for its `score` column so the number grammars can't drift.
 *   - `suspectDelimiter()` diagnoses a header that fails the required-columns
 *     check because the file uses a different delimiter from the one its
 *     format implies. It is diagnosis only: the format alone picks the
 *     delimiter (`DELIMITERS` in `./pipeline`), and nothing here ever
 *     re-reads a file with another one.
 *
 * We deliberately hand-roll the tokenizer rather than pull in
 * `d3-dsv`/`papaparse`: it is small and stable, the shipped web-component
 * bundle stays lean, and — crucially — owning the scanner is what lets us
 * emit the "row N, column X" errors the tickets require, which no
 * off-the-shelf parser produces.

 * Turn tokenized rows (header + data) into feature records.

 * have exactly as many fields as the header. `start`/`end` are coerced to
 * decimal numbers, must be finite whole numbers, and `end` may not precede
 * `start` (equal endpoints — a single residue — are fine, as in BED);
 * `score`, when the column is present and the cell is non-empty, is coerced
 * and validated but may be any decimal.
 *
 * On any violation this throws with a message naming the offending row (by
 * 1-based line number, header = line 1) and, where meaningful, the column —
 * e.g. `./hits.csv (parsed as CSV): row 3, column "start": expected a number,
 * got "abc"`. The loader's per-track try/catch records the throw as that track's
 * failure and leaves the track empty, so one bad file degrades one row. The
 * element routes it like any other track failure: this message is the ⚠
 * badge's text, the `protvista-error` event's `message`, and the console line
 * — so the author sees which row and column to fix without opening the
 * console.
 *
 * A missing required column throws {@link MissingHeaderColumnError}, which
 * `runPipeline` extends with a delimiter hint when the header looks like it
 * uses a different delimiter (see {@link suspectDelimiter}).
 *
 * Every other column is kept on the record, keyed by its trimmed header
 * name, in header order after the canonical fields (`./feature-fields` has
 * the rule):
 *
 *   - `color`, `shape`, `fill` are trimmed and `opacity` is coerced to a
 *     number from 0 to 1 (anything else is a row/column error); a blank cell
 *     leaves the field off, so the track's `rendering:` still applies to that
 *     row.
 *   - Any other column is kept as the verbatim cell string — untrimmed, and
 *     `''` when blank, so the column exists on every row.
 *   - `tooltipContent`, `locations`, `residuesToHighlight` and names on
 *     `Object.prototype` are dropped; an empty header name is dropped
 *     silently.
 *
 * `opts.rowNumbers`, when given, is an out-array: it receives each returned
 * record's row number (same numbering as the errors), in the same order as
 * the returned records. Skipped blank rows add nothing.
 *
 * `opts.warnings`, when given, is an out-array too: it receives at most one
 * `data-field-ignored` warning for the dropped column names, one more for
 * `shape` values dropped because they name an `Object.prototype` property
 * (`isReservedShape`), and one `unpaintable-color` warning (the `color` /
 * `fill` values a browser will not paint, which are still kept). Nothing is
 * logged either way; a call that throws pushes nothing.

 *
 * The third sibling of {@link rowsToFeatureRecords} / {@link rowsToPointRecords},
 * with the same discipline: the header must contain `position` and `variant`
 * (in any order, no duplicates), every data row must have exactly as many
 * fields as the header, and `position` is coerced through
 * {@link parseDecimal} and must be a whole number. Extra columns beyond the
 * documented optional ones are permitted and ignored.
 *
 * `variant` is a string, not a number — it is the residue (or residues) the
 * position changes to, `*` for a stop, `-` for a deletion. It is required to
 * be non-empty because an empty cell would silently render as "no change".
 *
 * Errors name the offending row by 1-based line number (header = line 1) and
 * the column, e.g.
 * `variation-csv: row 3, column "position": expected a number, got "abc"`.
 *
 * `opts.rowNumbers`, when given, is an out-array: it receives each returned
 * record's row number (same numbering as the errors), in the same order as
 * the returned records. Skipped blank rows add nothing.
